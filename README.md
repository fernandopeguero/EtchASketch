# **EtchASketch**
A fun and engaging digital Etch A Sketch game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to recreate the nostalgic drawing experience.

This project showcases my skills in creating interactive, grid-based layouts and dynamic styling with CSS, along with responsive event handling using JavaScript.

**Customizable Grid Size**: Users can select grid dimensions to adjust drawing detail, from large pixels to finer, more detailed sketches.
**Responsive Design**: The grid resizes to fit any screen, making the drawing experience smooth on both desktop and mobile.
**Clear and Reset Options**: Easily erase the canvas or reset the grid for new designs.
**Interactive Styling**: Includes customizable colors and hover effects, adding a playful, dynamic feel to each drawing session.
